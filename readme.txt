guide to make word more clearer:

To make fonts clearer in the Microsoft Edge browser, you can adjust several settings both within the browser and at the system level. Here are some steps you can take to optimize font clarity:

1. Enable ClearType Text
ClearType is a font-smoothing technology in Windows that makes text easier to read on LCD screens.

Open ClearType Text Tuner:

Press Windows + S to open the search bar.
Type ClearType and select Adjust ClearType text.
Enable ClearType:

Ensure that Turn on ClearType is checked.
Follow the on-screen instructions to adjust the ClearType settings for your display.

2. Adjust Font Smoothing in Edge
Microsoft Edge uses font smoothing settings from the operating system, but you can also adjust some settings within the browser.

Disable Hardware Acceleration:

Open Microsoft Edge.
Click on the three dots (...) in the upper-right corner to open the menu.
Select Settings.
Scroll down and click on System and performance.
Toggle off Use hardware acceleration when available.
Restart Edge.
Enable Experimental Features:

Open Microsoft Edge.
Type edge://flags in the address bar and press Enter.
Search for Font in the search bar.
Enable any experimental features related to font rendering or smoothing.
Restart Edge.

3. Adjust System Font Settings
Adjust DPI Scaling:

Right-click on the desktop and select Display settings.
Under Scale and layout, adjust the scaling percentage. A higher percentage can make text clearer on high-resolution displays.
Change Font Size:

In the Display settings, click on Advanced scaling settings.
Enter a custom scaling size if needed.
